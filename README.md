# Module API Examples

This repository is an SM Framework extension set intended on giving example
usage for all Module APIs exposed to Extension Developers.

Each extension within the set contains examples for the commands provided by the
corresponding API.

In order to install the set to be able to use the examples,

    sm ext install apidoc https://github.com/sm/sm_apidoc

Once you have installed the set you can then proceed to show examples for a
specific API command run that API command prefixed with sm.

Let's say that we want to know details about the 'array each' API command call,

    sm array each

Will display the examples for the array each api.
