# array(s) module api is loaded with the line 'api/array' in shell/includes.

# First we declare the my_array variable that we will use, as an array ('-a')
typeset -a my_array

# Now we assign five elements into our array.
my_array=(one two three four five)

# Printing out the array at this point should show these five elements:
# one two three four five
array print my_array


# This should print out the first element to standard output:
# one
array first "my_array"


# We can printout the index of the first element:
# 1
array first "my_array" index

# Let's declare a string variable
typeset my_variable

# We can specify to store the first element in a given variable name:
array first "my_array" as "my_variable"

# This should output:
# one
log $my_variable
