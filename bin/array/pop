# First we declare the my_array variable that we will use, as an array ('-a')
typeset -a my_array

# Now we assign five elements into our array.
my_array=(one two three four five)


# Printing out the array at this point should show these five elements:
# one two three four five
array print my_array

# We can pop off the last array element, using it like a stack.
# The following command should print 'five' to standard output.
array pop my_array

# If we now print the array, the last element should be removed:
# one two three four
array print my_array
