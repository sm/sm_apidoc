typeset -a my_array

includes api/array


: # Printing out the array at this point should show these five elements:
: # one two three four five
array print my_array


: # To print the array elements separated by comma-space (eg. ', ') we can do:
array join my_array separator ", "


: # We can print an array using CSV format:
array join my_array separator '", "' prefix '"' suffix '"'
