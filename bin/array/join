# array(s) module api is loaded with the line 'api/array' in shell/includes.

# First we declare the my_array variable that we will use, as an array ('-a')
typeset -a my_array

# Now we assign five elements into our array.
my_array=(one two three four five)


# Printing out the array at this point should show these five elements:
# one two three four five
array print my_array


# To print the array elements separated by comma-space (eg. ', ') we can do:
array join my_array separator ", "


# We can print an array using CSV format:
array join my_array separator '", "' prefix '"' suffix '"'
